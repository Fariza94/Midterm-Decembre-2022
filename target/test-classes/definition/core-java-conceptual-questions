Please answer the below core-java Questions:

What is programing language?
A.
A programming language is a vocabulary and set of grammatical rules used to instruct a computer or computing device to perform specific
tasks.
The term programming language usually refers to high-level languages such as BASIC, C, C++, COBOL, Java, FORTRAN, Ada, and Pascal.
-Java is one of the most popular programming language, created in 1995, it is owned by Oracle, and more than 3 billion devices run java.

Explain the entire java life cycle.
There are two main stages in the life cycle of a java program:
Compile time: During the compile time we create our java code and  type the program in a text-editor, we have to save the file (the file
must be saved with .java extension), and we call it a source code. It will go throw the compiler and the same file will go throw the JIT be
transformed into a.class file which is full of binaries.
Run time: during this step the binaries generated by the compiler will go throw the JIT compiler and will be transformed into a native code
that the machine understands and the code runs.

what is class?
Class is like a blueprint, it is a plan or template used to create objects and to define object data
types and methods


What is object?
Object in Java is an instance of a class

What is the entry point of an application?
The main method is the entry point of an application

Why main is static?
main is static, because it needs to be executed it without the creation of an object.

Which class is the superclass of all classes?
Object class is the superclass of all classes.

What is difference between path and classpath variables?
Path is set for java tools in java programs like java and javac, which are used to compile the code.
Classpath is used by System or Application class loader to locate and load compile Java bytecodes stored in
the .class file.

What is the difference between an Interface and Abstract class?
-Interface is slower than abstract class
-Interface can have only abstract method
-Keywords are different: Interface uses implement keyword and abstract uses extend keyword
-Abstract can have abstract method and non abstract method
-Variable in interface are final by default contrary to abstract
-Interface is road map
-Abstract class is hybrid class interface
-inheritance between interfaces is allowed
-In abstract class multiple inheritance is not allowed

Can you make an Object from an Interface and Abstract class ? if not how do you use it ?
No, we cannot make an Object from an Interface and Abstract class
we can implement a subclass of abstract class which must not be abstract

what is Access Specifier?
Access specifier is used to restrict visibility of a package, class, constructor, methods,
variables or other data members.
The four access specifier (modifier): public, default, protected and private.


What is OOP ? Define each feature of java OOP.
OOP stands for Object Oriented Programming
Features of Java OOP
-Abstraction
-Encapsulation
-Inheritance
-Polymorphism

What is Java Package and which package is imported by default?
Java package is like a folder, we create packages for organization purpose and because of accessibility, A package in Java is used to group related classes.
We use packages to avoid name conflicts,and to write a better maintainable code
The package imported by default is : Java.lang

What is API? Name list of API that you have used so far.
API is Application Programming Interface,it is a software intermediary that allows two applications to talk to each other.
API that i used so far : Java, Travel booking comparison, Google Maps..

Does java support multiple inheritance, explain why or why not?
no, because in java a class can not inherit from 2 classes or more, it can only inherits from a single class


What is method overloading and when it happens?
Method overloading occurs when two or more methods in one class have the same method name but different
parameters. it happens during the compiling time

Explain exceptions in java and how to handle it?
exceptions are the errors that we have in java, we have two types of exceptions: checked and unchecked or we call
them also Run time exceptions and compile time exceptions.
-To handle exceptions in java we can either use try and catch block, or use throws keyword in the method signature.

What is static keyword in java? How it has been used in variables and methods ?
The static keyword is an inaccessible modifier for methods and attributes, it makes any attribute belonging  to
a class, for every instance of this class created, these static members remain the same, they can not be changed
or modified.
in order to call any static attributes we don't need to create an object, we just need to use a name of a
class. and than call the attributes.

What is final and how it has been used variables and methods?
Final is a non access modifier used for classes, attributes and methods, which makes them non-changeable.
the impact of it for variables is we cannot reassign it
The impact of final for method is it cannot be overrided
the impact of final to à class is class cannot be inherited


What is final, finally and finalize?
-Final is a non access modifier used for classes, attributes and methods, which makes them non-changeable.
the impact of it for variables is we cannot reassign it
The impact of final for method is it cannot be overrided
the impact of final to à class is class cannot be inherited
-Finally is a keyword that is used after try and catch block, it is a block that is executed anyway.
-Finalize is a method that is used in garbage collection

What is a constructor ?
Constructor is block of code similar to class used to initialize the object (it is called when the object is
created)

Can we have multiple constructors in a class?
yes, we can have multiple constructors in a class.

If we don't have a constructor declared, what is called during the object creation?
it is called Default constructor, which is provided by Java.

What is "this" keyword in java ?
this keyword refers to the current object in a method or constructor

What is "super" keyword in java? How many possible way can you use?
It is à keyword that refers to super class


What is JVM stand for ?
Java Virtual Machine

Is JVM platform independent?
yes,JVM is platform independent because it can work in any environment any operating system.

What version of java are you using?
version 11.

What is JAR stand for ?
JAR stands for Java ARchive. It's a file format based on the popular ZIP file format and is used for
aggregating many files into one

What is the difference between JDK and JVM?
The Java Development Kit (JDK) is a software development environment for developing Java applications and applets.
It exists physically. It includes JRE + development tools. JDK includes a private Java Virtual Machine (JVM) and
some other resources such as interpreter/loader (Java), compiler (Java), archiver (Jar),documentation generator
(Javadoc), etc. to complete it Java application program development.
JVM (Java Virtual Machine) is an abstract machine. It is called a virtual machine because it does not physically
exist. It is a specification that provides a runtime environment in which Java bytecode can run. It can also run
programs written in other languages and compiled in Java bytecode. JVMs are available for many hardware and
software platforms.

What is the difference between JVM and JRE?
JRE is the implementation of JVM. It provides a platform to execute java programs.
JRE consists of JVM, Java binaries, and other classes to execute any program successfully.
JRE does not have contain development tools such as Java compiler, debugger.

What is compile time and run time?
Compile time is the period when the programming code (such as C#, Java, C, Python) is converted to the machine code
 ( binary code).
 Runtime is the period of time when a program is running  after compile time.

What is heap?
heap is an area of memory used to store objects instantiated by applications running on the JVM.
When the JVM starts, heap memory is created and all objects in the heap can be shared between threads as
long as the application is running.

How java manage it's memory?
Java does memory management automatically. it uses a garbage collector which is an automatic memory management system.

What is the difference between String, StringBuffer and StringBuilder?
String is immutable.
StringBuffer and StringBuilder are mutable classes

What is Singleton class?
Singleton class is used to hide an object

What is Serialization and Deserialization?
Serialization is a mechanism of converting the state of an object into a byte stream.
Deserialization is the reverse process where the byte stream is used to recreate the actual Java object in memory

when to use transient variable in java?
Transient in Java is used to indicate that a field should not be part of the serialization process. The modifier
Transient can be applied to member variables of a class to turn off serialization on these member variables.
Every field that is marked as transient will not be serialized

Difference between while and do..while loop?
The difference between while and do while loop is that in the while loop the
condition is checked prior to executing any statements whereas in the case of do while loop, statements
are run at least once, and then the condition is checked.

What is Enum?
An enum is a special class that represents a group of constants (unchangeable variables, like final variables)

What is Iterator?
An Iterator is an object that can be used to loop through collections, like ArrayList and HashSet. It is called an
iterator because "iterating" is the technical term for looping. To use an Iterator, we must import it from the
java.util package.

Which one will take more memory, an int or Integer?
Integer will take more memory

Why is String Immutable in Java?
String is Immutable because it makes reference to a java class, and because of the security, synchronization and
concurrency, caching, and class loading

What is constructor chaining in Java?
Constructor chaining refers to the ability to call a constructor inside another constructor.

The difference between Serial and Parallel Garbage Collector?
The primary difference between the serial and parallel collectors is that the parallel collector has multiple threads
that are used to speed up garbage collection. The parallel collector is intended for applications with medium-sized to
large-sized data sets that are run on multiprocessor or multithreaded hardware

What is JIT stands for?
Just In Time

Explain Java Heap space and Garbage collection?
Java objects reside in an area called the heap. The heap is created when the JVM starts up and may increase or decrease
in size while the application runs. When the heap becomes full, garbage is collected. garbage collection is  a java system
that is deleting the non used objects.

Can you guarantee the garbage collection process?
Java programmer are free from memory management. We cannot force the garbage collector to collect the garbage,it depends
on the JVM. If the Heap Memory is full, the JVM will not allow to create a new object and shows an error java.

What is the difference between stack and heap in Java?
Heap memory is used by all the parts of the application whereas stack memory is used only by one thread of execution.
Whenever an object is created, it's always stored in the Heap space and stack memory contains the reference to it.

What is reflection in java and why is it useful?
Reflection is a feature in the Java programming language. It allows an executing Java program to examine or "introspect"
upon itself, and manipulate internal properties of the program. For example, it's possible for a Java class to obtain
the names of all its members and display them.

what is multithreading in java?
Multithreading refers to a process of executing two or more threads simultaneously for maximum utilization of the CPU.
A thread in Java is a lightweight process requiring fewer resources to create and share the process resources.

What is the use of synchronization in Java?
Synchronization in java is the capability to control the access of multiple threads to any shared resource.
In the Multithreading concept, multiple threads try to access the shared resources at a time to produce inconsistent
results. The synchronization is necessary for reliable communication between threads.

What is Framework?
Java Framework is the body or platform of pre-written codes used by Java developers to develop Java applications
or web applications. In other words, Java Framework is a collection of predefined classes and functions that is
used to process input, manage hardware devices interacts with system software.

What are the testing Framework available in java?
1. Selenium
2. JUnit
3. TestNG
4. SerenityBDD
5. Mockito

Difference between jUnit and testNG?
JUnit is a framework that is open-source and may be used to write and trigger tests. TestNG is a Java-based
framework that provides an improved way to run tests. Advanced annotation is not supported.
It is capable of supporting more advanced annotation.

What are the dependencies for this project?*******************************************
what is dependency injection in java?
Dependency Injection in Java is a way to achieve Inversion of control (IoC) in our application by moving objects
binding from compile time to runtime. We can achieve IoC through Factory Pattern, Template Method Design Pattern,
Strategy Pattern and Service Locator pattern too

What is static binding and dynamic binding?
Static binding uses Type information for binding while Dynamic binding uses Objects to resolve binding.
Overloaded methods are resolved (deciding which method to be called when there are multiple methods with same name)
using static binding while overridden methods using dynamic binding, i.e, at run time
