Please answer the below Data Structure Questions:

why do we need data structure?
A. Data structure is a  way to store multiple data in one object.
   We need it to store multiple values or types in one object.


What are the various operations that can be performed on different Data Structures?
Delete. Add. Create , remove, retrieve, and others based on collections we are using.

List out the areas in which data structures are applied extensively?
Data structure is used everywhere (operating system, machine learning, data design....)

what is an Array?
Array is an object that holds multiple values,

what is the difference between the Array and ArrayList?
ArrayList is bounded list which has a certain value where you cannot go more then that unless we change it and in the
array we cannot have multiple types in one array, this is why collections framework are created where we can have unlimited sizes
of array as well as using multiple datatype in one type.
An array has both primitive data types as well as object data types. However, ArrayList has only object type data
entries and not primitive data types

what is LinkedList?
It is a list that uses notes in order to store the data.

How is an Array different from Linked List?
Behind Array list there are arrays.
Behind à linked list there is no array, there is notes.************

what is queue?
queue is a collection that uses the concept of first in first out and last in last out

what is stack?
Stack is a collection , it is a concept that is using first in last out
It also implements interfaces List,


what is FIFO and LIFO?
FIFO : first in first out
LIFO: last in first out

what is the order of complexity?
The most common complexity classes are (in ascending order of complexity): O(1), O(log n), O(n), O(n log n), O(n²)

what is the best case to search an element from an array?
The sequential search.

what is the worst case to search an element from an array?
The worst case complexity is O(n/2)

what is tree in data structure?
Tree is a collection where we have the child and parent relationship

what is graph in data structure?
A graph is a non-linear kind of data structure made up of nodes or vertices and edges.

what is the difference between the HashTable and HashMap?
HashTable is synchronized
HashMap is not synchronized
HashMap allows one null key and multiple null values whereas Hashtable doesn't allow any null key or value.

What are the major data structures used in the following areas : RDBMS, Network data model and Hierarchical data model.
How HashMap works in java?
HashMap stores entries into multiple singly linked lists, HashMap uses hashCode() and equals() methods on keys for get and put operations.

What is ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException in java? When it occurs?
it is an error that occurs when we try to access an index that is not available in a specific data structure or collection.

What are the different ways of copying an array into another array?
using for loop
Simply using the assignment operator.
Shallow Copy
Deep Copy

What is difference between an array and a linked list?
Behind Array list there are arrays.
Behind à linked list there is no array, there is notes.**************

What is DFS and BFS?
BFS(Breadth First Search) uses Queue data structure for finding the shortest path. DFS(Depth First Search) uses Stack data structure

What is Recursion?
a method that is calling itself.

What are linear and non linear data Structures?
linear data structure are list, set, queue
Non linear data structure are graph and tree

What is Big-(O)-notation?
it is a code to measure the complexity of the code,

Outlined different kind of sorting algorithm with time complexity?
Heap Sort
Quick Sort
Merge Sort

Draw a table with time complexity in which it will summarize all the data structure feature's advantages and disadvantages.
  a)In terms of Accessing element.
  b)In terms of Inserting element.
  c)In terms of Searching element.
  d)In terms of Removing element.
